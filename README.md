# Complex Networks | Projects

In this repository, you can find the simulations and analysis carried out for the final exam of the **Physics of Complex Networks: Structure and Dynamics** course in the *Physics of Data* master’s program, **University of Padova**, **AY 2025/26**.

In particular, the repository contains the code and the report for **two different tasks**.

## SOC model (#15)

Theoretical characterization and numerical analysis of the **Bak–Tang–Wiesenfeld sandpile model** for self-organized criticality.  
This model represents a paradigmatic mechanism leading to complex behavior, cascade failures, and power-law distributed events.  
The analysis focuses on the critical properties of the system and its behavior on different network topologies.  

**Score:** 0.6.

## Social Connectedness Index (#44)

The **Social Connectedness Index (SCI)** is a measure of the strength of social connections between pairs of geographical regions, based on an anonymized snapshot of active Facebook users.  
The project involves building networks at the level of GADM NUTS3 areas for countries with sufficient data coverage, producing node and edge lists, and performing a simplified network analysis to compare country-level structures.  

**Score:** 1.0.
